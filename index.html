          <p>
              I’m a Web Designer that works in both a creative and technical capacity. I believe that every website is different, and every need requires a different method and approach. The challenge is to find the way that works for my clients and that solves the needs of the project. When I am not pushing pixels I switch my computer off for reading, long distance running, and updating my programming knowledge. I am a perfectionist with a real passion for Art and Design. I specialize in clean and functional websites built respecting the latest web standards.
          </p>
          <p>
          I strive for perfection in everything I do and continually educate myself to ensure I’m on top of current web design trends. I believe in being bold, taking risks, and thinking outside the box. This reflects my deeply held belief that great design cannot happen without passion, intelligent approaches, and — above all — my personal commitment to achieving your goals. These principles are demonstrated by a portfolio that spans 7 successful years, and covers a wide variety of industries.
